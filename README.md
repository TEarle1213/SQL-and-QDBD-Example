# Employee Database Example

Given already cleaned and normalized data across six Excel files, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram with QuickDBD before importing all of the data into SQL. Performed several requested queries before transistioning to Jupyter Notebook in order to use Python(Pandas, Matplotlib) to create visualizations of salary data from the set. 


All data was created for this exercise, no employee privacy was harmed in the making of this repository.
